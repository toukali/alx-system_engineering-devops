### Solutions to 0x19: Postmortem
**DevOps - Systems Administration**

**Issue Summary:**
On May 13th, 2024, from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM (GMT), our e-commerce website went down completely. The website became unresponsive, and users couldn't access it during this time.

**Impact:**
The outage affected all services on the website, including product listings, the shopping cart, and the checkout process. Users trying to access the site saw error messages or an unresponsive page. We estimate that about 80% of our users were affected.

**Root Cause:**
The outage was caused by a memory leak in our web application server. The memory leak made the server overloaded and unresponsive, causing the entire website to go down.

**Timeline:**
- **2:30 PM:** Our monitoring system detected the issue and alerted the operations team.
- **2:35 PM:** The operations team tried to restart the web application server, but this didn't fix the problem.
- **2:40 PM:** The team. started investigating, thinking the issue was with the server's configuration.
- **3:00 PM:** They noticed the server's memory usage was very high, which suggested a memory leak.
- **3:15 PM:** The team began examining the application's code to find the cause of the memory leak.
- **3:45 PM:** They found the memory leak in the code and started working on a fix.
- **4:30 PM:** The fix was deployed and the web application server was restarted.
- **4:45 PM:** The website was back online and working normally.

**Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:**
At first, the team thought the problem was with the server's configuration, which wasted time. This delayed finding the real cause of the problem.

**Incident Escalation:**
The operations team initially handled the issue but escalated it to the development team when they realized it was related to the application's code.

**Resolution:**
The memory leak in the web application code was found and fixed. The fix involved optimizing the code and improving memory management. After deploying the fix, the server was restarted, and the website was fully functional again.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
To prevent this from happening again, we will:
- Do regular code reviews to find potential memory leaks.
- Implement stricter testing to catch memory leaks before they reach production.
- Improve monitoring of server performance and resource usage.
- Enhance documentation and training for the operations team to better handle such incidents.

**Specific tasks to address the issue include:**
- Conduct a thorough code review of the web application.
- Implement more automated tests to detect memory leaks.
- Update monitoring tools for more detailed resource usage data.
- Provide additional training for operations team members on troubleshooting web application issues.
